# 50-projects

Inspired by the **50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript** course taught by
Brad Traversy.

I have used the course as a starting point for each project, adding my own extra styling
and/or functionality in most cases.

The original projects can be found within the course over at Udemy:
[50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)

## Examples of some of my projects can be found on my CodePen site:
